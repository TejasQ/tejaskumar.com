### Trolling

This website is meant to be _fun_ and _funny_ and all kinds of wonderful. Here are two ways that I try and keep it fun.

#### Tej-variants

On every load of the web page, a different "nickname" of mine is displayed. I call these "Tej-variants".
[See for yourself!](https://tejaskumar.com) You could
[add your own](https://github.com/TejasQ/tejaskumar.com/edit/master/util/tej-variants.ts) interesting Tej-variant (like
**Tejackson** or something) if you like.

#### Photos

As you move your cursor (desktop) or tap (mobile), [you see different pictures of me](https://tejaskumar.com) Including
[me as a flower ðŸŒ·](https://github.com/TejasQ/tejaskumar.com/blob/master/public/tejass/13.png). You could add a picture
of me as weird as you'd like [like this](https://github.com/TejasQ/tejaskumar.com/pull/2/files) and we can have some
fun.

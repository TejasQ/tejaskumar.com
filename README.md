### Tej-variants

On every load of the web page, a different "nickname" of mine is displayed. I call these "Tej-variants". [See for yourself!](https://tejaskumar.com) You could [add your own](https://github.com/TejasQ/tejaskumar.com/edit/master/util/tej-variants.ts) interesting Tej-variant (like Tejackson or something) if you like.

### Photos

As you move your cursor (desktop) or tap (mobile), you see different pictures of me. Including [me as a flower ðŸŒ·](https://github.com/TejasQ/tejaskumar.com/blob/master/static/tejass/13.png). You could add a picture of me as weird as you'd like [like this](https://github.com/TejasQ/tejaskumar.com/pull/2/files) and we can have some fun.

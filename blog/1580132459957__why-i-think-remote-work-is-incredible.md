# Why I think remote work is incredible

Two months ago, I started a new job at [G2i](https://g2i.co/) that is fully remote. Here’s why I think working from home is incredible. 

## Prior Art

In all my on-site desk jobs, I’ve often struggled with self care: I rarely had the chance to get enough sleep, and when I did, it was seldom stress-free. 

Morning meetings would ruin the night before, and location-sensitive events would interrupt the regular working day. The result? Less-than-happy Tejas. 

## On-site work in a nutshell

To put it succinctly, my experience working on-site was so:

* Go to bed stressing out about waking up on time and making the morning Standup
* Can’t sleep because I REALLY WANT TO FALL ASLEEP right now
* Wake up unrested, continue to stress out about being on time
* Get to the office on time to find out the morning meeting moved
* Ok, at least there’s free coffee 
* Start coding 
* Ah, it’s time for the [probably unneeded] meeting
* *talk talk talk^
* Okay where was I 
* Start coding 
* Oh it’s time for lunch
* Eat
* Coffee
* Yes, back to work 💪🏾 
* Ah, another meeting 
* What?! It’s 4pm already?!
* Okay, time to code
* Oh. Planning meeting. Right. 
* Hm. 6pm and I didn’t get as deep as I wanted to. 😕
* K home time
* want to gym but I’m tired
* hi wife how are you 
* start stressing out about going to bed on time to wake up on time 
* repeat

I should say that this isn’t targeted to one specific employer or work environment. This is pretty much the pattern I’ve seen in most working environments that were bound to an office location.

## Remote work in a nutshell 

What does remote work look like, expressed as bullet points? How does it compare? This is what I’ve experienced over the last 2 months:

* Wake up, all my coworkers are asleep
* Make coffee just the way I like it at home 😌
* Focused, uninterrupted work because it’s like 4am where most of my coworkers are 
* OK things are green. Time to commit. 
* Hm. It’s beautiful outside. Let’s go to the gym. 
* Ok, back to work. 
* Focused, quality work time. 
* Around 5pm: time for meetings!
* Finish the day talking to people I appreciate after feeling like I contributed meaningful code.
* Encourage some of them to go about their day well. 
* Go to bed satisfied. 
* Repeat. 

## Remote work: the not-so-incredible parts


## It’s not binary 

This is speaking only of my experience (and my experience _so far_) with remote work. I have never worked a remote job before in my life and these are preliminary findings. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a whole other side to this coin that I have not yet seen. 

I’m sure it’s not entirely binary, but a spectrum of good and bad. 

What do you think? Do you agree with me? Do you disagree? What was your experience like? I’d love to hear your perspective. Let me know on [twitter](https://twitter.com/tejaskumar_).
